# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

## User Story

Our users would like to create employees for a team and then have the entire team displayed on the screen. This app allows creators to generate a array of different employees by simply answering the questions given in Node. Users will be able to see the the input employees on the screen and with desired value sets.

## How it Works

This app uses the require function to add "Inquirer" and "Jest" into our app so that we can build our employees and test to make sure the app works.
* The Inquirer function allows us to use .prompt function which is an array of objects.
      * Each object is a question that allows us to complete the new README.
* Jest allows us to set tests that look at the uniformity and functionality of the code.
      * This is what we use to make sure all the keys are correct for the various classes.
* I was able to render the page after completing the inquirer by running the render funtion

## Items For Later
* I would like to make it so the webpage opens after the Node CLI is finished running

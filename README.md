# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

## Creation

This app allows creators to generate a array of different employees by simply answering the questions given in node. 

## How it Works

This app uses the require function to add "Inquirer" and "Jest" into our app so that we can build our employees and test to make sure the app works.
* The Inquirer function allows us to use .prompt function which is an array of objects.
      * Each object is a question that allows us to complete the new README.
* Jest allows us to set tests that look at the uniformity and functionality of the code.
      * This is what we use to make sure all the keys are correct for the various classes.
